# Pi-hole Easy Control

This project aims to create an easy web dashboard for people to Manage their Pi-hole installations. Pi-hole Easy Control does not aim to replace the Pi-hole web dashboard. Just provide some basic functionality like disabling it, enabling it, setting static IPs for devices (if using the Pi-hole DHCP server), etc.
